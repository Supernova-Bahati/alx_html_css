# CSS Advanced Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates advanced CSS styling based on a provided HTML structure and Figma design file. The goal is to replicate the design with accuracy and clean CSS practices.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand what CSS is and how to apply it to HTML elements.
- Use classes and selectors effectively.
- Compute CSS specificity values.
- Apply box properties (margin, padding, border, etc.).
- Understand how browsers load and render web pages.

## Files

- `styles.css` — CSS styles for all sections.
- `README.md` — Project documentation.

## How to Run
1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Make sure `styles.css` is properly linked in the head of the HTML.

## Notes
- All styles are implemented using pure CSS (no frameworks or libraries).
- Code validates with W3C Validator.
- Fonts used: Source Sans Pro, Spin Cycle OT.
