# Headphones Landing Page

This project is part of the **ALX Front-End Specialization**, where the objective is to build a complete webpage from scratch based on a Figma design by **Nicolas Philippot (UI/UX Designer)**.  
The page must be fully responsive, accessible, and match the designer’s layout as closely as possible — using **only HTML and CSS** (until Task 8).

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The landing page is built step-by-step through multiple tasks:

1. Header & Hero section  
2. “What we do” section  
3. “Our results” section  
4. Contact form  
5. Footer  
6. CSS-drawn pentagons (no images)  
7. Animations  
8. Hamburger menu using vanilla JavaScript  

Each task builds on the previous one to form the complete webpage.
